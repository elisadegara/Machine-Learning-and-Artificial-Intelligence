In this project, we deal with the task of Monocular Depth Estimation, a computer vision task consisting in estimating the distance relative to the camera of each pixel of an RGB image. We employ the NYU-Depth V2 dataset and implement CNN-based encoder-decoder architectures (see details in the .pdf file) to produce as output an image of the same size as the input, but with only one channel, where each pixel represents the relative distance from the camera of the corresponding pixel in the RGB image.
